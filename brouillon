<h1>🎥 Exploring gender and character tropes in films</h1>

            <h3>🎯 Objective</h3>
            <p> In film, we often believe that there is a strong gendered representation of characters, with distinct traits and roles assigned to men and women.
            In this first part of our analysis, we will explore how characters are described across genders. Do the same words describe both men and women, or 
            are the descriptions different? 
            Are male and female characters portrayed with similar complexity? </p>

                    <p><strong>📊 Overall Representation</strong>: Women account for only <strong>30%</strong> of all characters in movies, a figure that has remained largely stagnant over decades.</p>
                    <p><strong>🎭 Trope Representation</strong>: In the dataset of trope-rich roles, only <strong>14%</strong> of characters are female, compared to <strong>86%</strong> male.</p>

              🟢 <strong>Observations</strong>
              
              
              <p>There are 6 times more male occurence of these character tropes than female ones, which means that only 14% of the characters in this tropes dataset are women. 
              This is half the count of women in films that we showed above which was already low. This shows that there are in addition to having a lot less female representation 
              in movies, we also lack the data on which type of characters these actresses portray. The most common trope we see here for women are "dumb blonde" and "brainless beauty" 
              which are very stereotypical tropes. However, it is important to note again that the dataset is not big enough and there is clearly not enough data for women archetypes.</p>
              


            <h2>📝 Lexical analysis: descriptive words</h2>

            <p>Now that we have observed the differences in the distribution and types of character tropes between genders, we will take a closer
                 look at the lexical choices used to describe them. In this second part of the gender analysis, we will examine the variety and complexity of verbs 
                 and adjectives associated with male and female characters. How diverse is the language used for each gender? Are the descriptions nuanced or
                  reductive? 
                This will help us better understand how language contributes to the portrayal of gender in films.</p>
