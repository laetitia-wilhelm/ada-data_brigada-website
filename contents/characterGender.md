# **Exploring Gender and Character Tropes in Film**  

## **Objective**  
This study explores the differences in character tropes based on gender in films. It examines:

2. Differences in descriptive language (adjectives and verbs).  
3. Broader implications for storytelling and character development.

## **Gender Representation in Film**  

### **1. Overall Gender Distribution**  
Women represent only **30%** of characters in films, a value that has remained consistent over the years. This low representation highlights a long-standing gender imbalance in the industry.  

### **2. Gender Distribution in Tropes Dataset**  
Within the dataset of analyzed character tropes, only **14%** of trope-associated characters are female, while **86%** are male. This proportion is significantly lower than womenâ€™s overall representation in films.  

| **Metric**                 | **Male** | **Female** |
|----------------------------|----------|------------|
| **Total Characters**       | 86%      | 14%        |
| **Trope Prevalence Ratio** | 6:1      | -          |

#### **Key Observations**  
1. There are **6 times more male characters** than female characters in trope-rich roles.  
2. This suggests that women are not only underrepresented in films overall but are also excluded from many key narrative archetypes.

## **Lexical Analysis: Descriptive Words**  

### **3. Word Count Per Character**  
The average number of descriptive words (adjectives and verbs) per character is significantly different for men and women:  

| **Metric**            | **Male Characters** | **Female Characters** |
|------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Mean**              | 2.34 words         | 1.71 words            |
| **Median**            | 2                  | 2                     |
| **Maximum**           | 5 words            | 3 words               |

#### **Key Observations**  
1. Male characters are described using **37% more words** on average than female characters.  
2. The disparity in word count reflects a greater focus on male characters in storytelling, with men receiving more detailed and nuanced portrayals.

### **4. Adjective Usage**  

#### **Male Characters**  
Male characters are described using a wide range of adjectives, reflecting diverse and complex portrayals.  

| **Adjective**          | **Frequency** |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| *Crazy, jealous*       | 398           |
| *Byronic*              | 290           |
| *Corrupt, corporate*   | 247           |
| *Cultured*             | 104           |
| *Romantic*             | 72            |
| *Egomaniac*            | 91            |

#### **Female Characters**  
Female characters are often described with stereotypical adjectives, many of which are reductive or negative.  

| **Adjective**          | **Frequency** |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| *Dumb blonde*          | 62            |
| *Arrogant*             | 5             |
| *Eccentric*            | 3             |

#### **Key Observations**  
1. Male descriptors include terms like *Byronic* (a complex, moody archetype) and *cultured*, reflecting nuanced roles.  
2. Female descriptors focus on shallow stereotypes like *dumb blonde* or *arrogant*, limiting character depth and narrative significance.

### **5. Verb Usage**  

#### **Male Characters**  
Male characters are associated with action-oriented verbs that emphasize their roles and personalities.  

| **Verb**         | **Frequency** |
|-------------------|---------------|
| *Drill*          | 93            |
| *Retired*        | 81            |
| *Turned*         | 53            |
| *Hardboiled*     | 87            |

#### **Female Characters**  
Female characters are associated with fewer verbs, and the ones present reflect passivity or simplicity.  

| **Verb**         | **Frequency** |
|-------------------|---------------|
| *Klutz*          | 9             |
| *Broken*         | 44            |

#### **Key Observations**  
1. Male characters are described with verbs that suggest activity, competence, and purpose.  
2. Female characters are rarely associated with verbs, and when they are, the words often imply weakness or lack of agency.

## **Broader Observations**  

### **6. Sentiment Analysis of Descriptive Words**  
A deeper analysis of the sentiment of adjectives and verbs reveals:  

| **Gender** | **Sentiment**      | **Examples**                 |
|------------|--------------------|------------------------------|
| **Male**   | Mixed              | Positive (*cultured*), Negative (*corrupt*). |
| **Female** | Predominantly Negative | Mostly reductive (*dumb blonde*, *broken*). |

#### **Key Observations**  
1. Male characters enjoy a balance of positive and negative sentiment, indicating multidimensional portrayals.  
2. Female characters are predominantly described in negative terms, reinforcing limited archetypes.  

---

## **Conclusions and Implications**  

### **Key Findings**  
1. **Underrepresentation**: Female characters are severely underrepresented in both films and trope-rich roles.  
2. **Simplistic Portrayals**: Women are described with fewer words, and their descriptors often reinforce stereotypes.  
3. **Narrative Depth**: Male characters benefit from more descriptive language, allowing for complex and varied narratives.  

### **Broader Implications**  
- **For Storytelling**: This imbalance limits the diversity of narratives and reduces the impact of female characters on storytelling.  
- **For Cultural Representation**: The reliance on stereotypes perpetuates outdated views of gender roles, failing to reflect evolving societal norms.  

### **Future Directions**  
1. **Expand Female Archetypes**: Increase the variety and depth of roles for female characters to create more balanced storytelling.  
2. **Analyze Trends Over Time**: Investigate how these disparities have evolved and identify opportunities for positive change.  
3. **Larger Datasets**: Incorporate more comprehensive datasets to enable a deeper and more accurate analysis of character tropes.
