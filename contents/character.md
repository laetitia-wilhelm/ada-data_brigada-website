# **Visualization of the character tropes data**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**  
To study the representation of character tropes in films and explore how they influence the movie industry, we must first define and look at the tropes we are working with. We will visualize the distribution of character tropes in the dataset `tv_tropes` to have an idea of the most common character tropes and see if those common characters can differ across genres and time.

  </div>

ðŸŸ¢ **Observation**: 
We can see that the most common tropes of this dataset are "crazy jealous guy" and "corrupt corporate executive". The least common trope is "classy cat burglar" which is not that surprising because it is a very specific kind of character that can only appear in very peculiar cases of movies.
